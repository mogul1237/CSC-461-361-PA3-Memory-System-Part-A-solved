• See Piazza for due date and time o Grading the next day • Submit program to perforce in your student directory o Sub directory called:  /PA3/… o Fill out your PA3 Submission Report.pdf  Place it in the same directory as your solution  Enter the final Changelist number of your submission  Enter the number of test passed • Part A: requires 6 tests to be passed from the supplied tests  Write up a quick discussion in the report • What you learned from this assignment so far
• Learn o To Create a Memory System from scratch • Understand the internals of a memory system
1. Create a memory system within a heap • Take the given memory system framework for the heap layout: o Add the allocators o Add the de-allocators • Run the Test functions that handles a set of memory allocation and de-allocations o Supplied by Instructor o Part A: tests 1-6 minimum, you can do more • Diagram the data structure layout out – to help you.
2. Take Memory system, use the stress test • Measure the timing with default setting in the compiler o For the original memory system o For your custom memory system • Measure the difference. o Write the before and after in an output text file • Instructor will provide the stress test o Intended for Part B o Provided to let you a jump start on Part B
Optimized C++ Programming Assignment 1
Optimized C++ PA -3 Fall 2014 Keenan
General:
• Write all programs in cross-platform C or C++. o Optimize for execution speed and robustness. • Create a programming file for each problem, for example o Student directory  /PA3/memory/… o Make sure that each problem can be compiled and run through the checked in solution
• Do all your work by yourself o Feel free to talk with others about ideas and problems o But do not copy your friend’s code.  Please don’t – I can tell with my difference tools o Feel free to share ideas • Check in the problems multiple times o At least 3 times per problem  For this project it might be closer to 40 o Have reasonable check-in comments o Seriously, I’m checking • Make sure that your program compiles and runs o Warning level 4, some times that is not possible due to MS headers… o Your code should be squeaky clean. • We are using Perforce o You should have received the document describing how to login.  Please look at the documentation and videos under the reference directory o Submit program to perforce in your student directory  Sub directory called: /PA3/… • As described above o All your code must compile from perforce with no modifications.  Otherwise it’s a 0, no exceptions o Only Visual Studio 2012 allowed
Optimized C++ Programming Assignment 2
Optimized C++ PA -3 Fall 2014 Keenan
Simple check list to make sure that everything is checked in correctly • Do they compile and run without any errors? • Submitted it into /PA3 directory? • Did you do the submission report? • Can you delete you local drive, regrab the PA3 directory? o Is all the code there? o Does it compile?
Most assignments will have hints in a section like this. • Do many little check-ins o Iteration is easy and it helps. o Perforce is good at it. • Look at the lecture notes! o A lot of good ideas in there. o The code in the examples work.
• Use the Piazza o This is much harder than the last assignment. o See me during office hours. o Read, explore, ask questions in class
